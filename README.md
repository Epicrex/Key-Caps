Of those the most common ones in pre-built keybaords are `OEM` and `CHERRY`. `SA` is also not to rare for custom keybaords and `DSA` as well as `XDA` are gaining traction for custom keybaords, but still less used than all prior mentoined ones.

# Physical Layouts [#table-of-contents]


The Physical key laout is not indicative of if the keycap print is QWERT or QWERTZ.

The most common physical layouts are `ANSI` and `ISO`. And in Japan `JIS` is also quite common.

# Keycap Types [#table-of-contents]

The plastic of the keycaps can be either made of `PBT` or `ABS`. Note that not all keycap types are avaiable with both plastic types. `ABS` only has `Laser-etched`, `Pad-printed` and `Double-shot`.

## Laser-etched
Laser-etched keycaps have the legends embeded into the plastic using lasers, making the permanent.
- Will never fade
- Looks sharp
- Any color legend possible

## Double-shot
Double-shot keycaps have the legend and keycap made seperatly and then fused together.
- Will never fade
- Looks sharp
- Any color legend possible

## Backlit
Backlit keycaps can either be `Laser-etched` or `Double-shot`, but have transparent plasitc embeded into the keycap to allow for light to pass through.

- Light shines through legends
- As well as all attributes from either `Laser-etched` or `Double-shot`

## Dye-sublimated
Dye-sublimated keycaps are created by printing the legends on special paper and then merging them onto keycaps using high heat.
- May fade a little over time
- May look less sharp
- More complex designs possible
- Legend must be darker than keycap

## Pad-printed
Pad-printed keycaps are created by stamping the print onto the keycap They are a worse version of `Dye-sublimated` keycaps.
- Will fade quite quickly
- Cheapest
- Legends can be felt
- May look less sharp
- More complex designs possible

## Artisan/ Resin

- Unique designs
- Most expensive

## Pudding
There are also Pudding keycaps which have transparent plastic on the sides and mostly come as `Backlit` keycaps.
